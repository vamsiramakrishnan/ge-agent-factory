- [Household 6041288's account 80417723 (rollover_401k) had its DocuSign envelope rejected NIGO twice this week -- the custodian cites a missing spousal consent on today's third resubmission -- but Salesforce Financial Services Cloud still shows the account as 'active' with the ACAT transfer marked complete in yesterday's BigQuery analytics_events snapshot. Reconcile the record and tell me whether we can publish the funded status to the advisor.](/tests/wealth-client-onboarding-orchestrator-nigo-resubmission-conflict.md)
