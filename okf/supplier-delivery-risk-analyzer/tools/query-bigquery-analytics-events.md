- [Looker's on-time-delivery dashboard shows 92% this quarter for vendor 'Ashgrove Metal Works', but BigQuery analytics_events lists a -18.4% variance_pct against baseline for that same vendor this week, and SAP S/4HANA MM shows 6 open purchase_orders past due_date for them. Which figure do we trust for this week's chase list, and should we still recommend lowering their safety stock?](/tests/supplier-delivery-risk-analyzer-signal-reconciliation.md)
