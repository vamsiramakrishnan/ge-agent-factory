## Evals

- [Run the Revenue Leakage Detection Analyzer workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/revenue-leakage-detection-analyzer-end-to-end.md)
- [Billing account 40381922 (credit_class: class_b_standard) has a recoverable leakage estimate of $6,200 flagged against rated_events on rate plan LEGACY_SHARE_10GB dated 2026-06-02, but the BigQuery analytics_events baseline for that account hasn't refreshed since 2026-05-28 — five days stale.
