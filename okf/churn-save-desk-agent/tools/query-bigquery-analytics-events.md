- [Account 48213077 (interaction_id 612044501) called in with intent=cancel_request on 2026-07-02. The rep's agent_notes say 'customer says internet keeps dropping' but queue_metrics for the retention queue on that date shows service_level_80_20_pct at 91.4% and abandon_rate_pct at 2.1% — no service degradation. Before recommending a save offer, reconcile the stated complaint against the queue telemetry and tell me what's actually driving this cancellation and what offer to lead with.](/tests/churn-save-desk-agent-driver-misattribution.md)
