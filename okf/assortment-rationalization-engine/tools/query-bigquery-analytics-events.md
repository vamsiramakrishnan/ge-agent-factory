- [SKU 84213067 (class 4412, salty_snacks, buyer Jordan Reyes) has a cost_changes record from vendor 502931 raising unit cost from $2.10 to $2.65 effective 2026-06-28, but approval_status is still 'pending' and item_master still shows unit_cost at $2.10. The BigQuery analytics_events productivity read for this SKU is 9 days old.
