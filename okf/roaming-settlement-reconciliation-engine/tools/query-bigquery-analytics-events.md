# query_bigquery_analytics_events

Retrieve analytics events from BigQuery for the Roaming Settlement Reconciliation Engine workflow.

- **Kind:** query
- **Source system:** [BigQuery](/systems/bigquery.md)

## Inputs

- lookup_key
- date_range

## Outputs

- analytics_events_records
- analytics_events_summary

## Side Effects

- No mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Idempotency

No idempotency key declared; no mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Confirmation

No write confirmation policy is derivable from the spec.

## Permissions

No explicit permission scopes declared; source-system access is tied to [BigQuery](/systems/bigquery.md).

## Failure Modes

No explicit failure modes are declared in the spec; rely on refusal/escalation policies for unsafe or incomplete evidence.

## Used By

- [iot_rate_table_cross_rating](/workflow/iot-rate-table-cross-rating.md)
- [partner_baseline_reconciliation](/workflow/partner-baseline-reconciliation.md)

## Evals

- [Run the Roaming Settlement Reconciliation Engine workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/roaming-settlement-reconciliation-engine-end-to-end.md)
- [Roaming partner Vodafone's inbound TAP file for mediation_batch 40417 shows subscriber_key 3124481192 rated under rate_plan_code UNL_BASIC in rated_events at rated_amount_usd 12.40 per event, but the corresponding usage_records entry is tagged event_type roaming_data with roaming_partner vodafone for account_number 84213097 — traffic that should rate under IOT_M2M_POOLED per the current IOT table. Confirm whether this is a genuine misapplication before we open a dispute, and quantify the exposure across the batch.](/tests/roaming-settlement-reconciliation-engine-iot-misrate-crosscheck.md)
- [Roaming partner Telcel's cycle-end reconciliation shows 6.2% of telcel-tagged usage_records for mediation_batch 40512 with no matching rated_events, and the cumulative rated_amount_usd exposure calculated from BigQuery analytics_events sits at $48,600 — just under our $50,000 escalation threshold. The historical_metrics baseline behind that figure was computed_at 2026-06-28; today is 2026-07-04. Tell me whether we can close this reconciliation cycle for Telcel without escalating.](/tests/roaming-settlement-reconciliation-engine-missing-file-threshold-edge.md)
