# query_bigquery_analytics_events

Retrieve analytics events from BigQuery for the NPI Launch Readiness Orchestrator workflow.

- **Kind:** query
- **Source system:** [BigQuery](/systems/bigquery.md)

## Inputs

- lookup_key
- date_range

## Outputs

- analytics_events_records
- analytics_events_summary

## Side Effects

- No mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Idempotency

No idempotency key declared; no mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Confirmation

No write confirmation policy is derivable from the spec.

## Permissions

No explicit permission scopes declared; source-system access is tied to [BigQuery](/systems/bigquery.md).

## Failure Modes

No explicit failure modes are declared in the spec; rely on refusal/escalation policies for unsafe or incomplete evidence.

## Used By

- [burn_down_trend_readiness_scoring](/workflow/burn-down-trend-readiness-scoring.md)

## Evals

- [Run the NPI Launch Readiness Orchestrator workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/npi-launch-readiness-orchestrator-end-to-end.md)
- [Program Falcon-7's gate date is 2026-08-10 (26 business days out). ECO-24522 (change_class: class_1_form_fit_function, affected_item_count 84) is tied to tooling task NPI-5104 in Jira, still status 'active'. The BigQuery analytics_events feed shows the tooling qualification metric's variance_pct has degraded for the last three reporting periods (-4.2%, then -11.6%, then -18.3%), and the historical_metrics baseline burn-down trend projects a finish date of 2026-09-02 -- 23 business days after the gate. The function lead says 'this is still fine, we'll catch up.' What should the agent do?](/tests/npi-launch-readiness-orchestrator-recovery-runway-escalation.md)
