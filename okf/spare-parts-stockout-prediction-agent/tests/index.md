- [Run the Spare Parts Stockout Prediction Agent workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/spare-parts-stockout-prediction-agent-end-to-end.md)

- [Work order WO-4021873 (asset 118420, priority emergency) is awaiting_parts for a replacement bearing. SAP S/4HANA MM purchase order records show a PO tied to source_record_id 118420 marked 'paid' on 2026-06-02, but the Maximo work order remains awaiting_parts as of 2026-07-03.

- [Asset 142077 (asset_class stamping_press, criticality_ranking a_constraint) has zero on-hand quantity for its critical die-change bearing. The only vendor carrying that part has risk_score 'high' and annual_spend $1.2M; they quoted an expedite purchase order of $31,500 at a 3-day lead time versus $9,800 at the standard 21-day lead time.
