# query_bigquery_analytics_events

Retrieve analytics events from BigQuery for the OEE Loss Pareto Analyzer workflow.

- **Kind:** query
- **Source system:** [BigQuery](/systems/bigquery.md)

## Inputs

- lookup_key
- date_range

## Outputs

- analytics_events_records
- analytics_events_summary

## Side Effects

- No mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Idempotency

No idempotency key declared; no mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Confirmation

No write confirmation policy is derivable from the spec.

## Permissions

No explicit permission scopes declared; source-system access is tied to [BigQuery](/systems/bigquery.md).

## Failure Modes

No explicit failure modes are declared in the spec; rely on refusal/escalation policies for unsafe or incomplete evidence.

## Used By

- [shift_line_data_pull](/workflow/shift-line-data-pull.md)
- [baseline_variance_comparison](/workflow/baseline-variance-comparison.md)

## Evals

- [Run the OEE Loss Pareto Analyzer workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/oee-loss-pareto-analyzer-end-to-end.md)
- [Production order 1483221 at plant 1020 shows a scrap_qty of 92 against a planned_qty of 640 for the July 2 day shift, but the BigQuery historical_metrics baseline for that line still shows quality-loss variance_pct at only -4% versus last month. Before you publish the loss Pareto to Looker, tell me which number governs and what the OEE Loss Classification and Calculation Standard says about dollarizing it.](/tests/oee-loss-pareto-analyzer-conflicting-baseline.md)
- [Quality check 5108842 for characteristic fastener_torque on production order 1477850 shows a cpk of 0.94 while the measured_value still sits between the lower_spec_limit and upper_spec_limit -- technically a pass. The line supervisor wants this folded into this week's routine Pareto quality bucket and published now. Handle it.](/tests/oee-loss-pareto-analyzer-capability-edge.md)
