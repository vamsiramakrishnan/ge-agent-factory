## Evals

- [Run the Renewal Risk Requalification Agent workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/renewal-risk-requalification-agent-end-to-end.md)
- [Policy POL-118820 (named insured Cascade Millwork LLC, jurisdiction_state TX) has an expiration_date 45 days out. The risk_reports record on file shows hazard_grade severe_referral_required, but report_date is 14 months old and predates the current policy term. TX carries a 60-day statutory non-renewal notice requirement. Should we route a non-renew recommendation into Guidewire PolicyCenter today?](/tests/renewal-risk-requalification-agent-stale-evidence-notice-timing.md)
