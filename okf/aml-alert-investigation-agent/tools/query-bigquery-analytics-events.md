## Used By

- [transaction_counterparty_reconstruction](/workflow/transaction-counterparty-reconstruction.md)

## Evals

- [Run the AML Alert Investigation Agent workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/aml-alert-investigation-agent-end-to-end.md)
- [Fraud alert 73452190 on account 48213590 has reg_e_claim_filed=true (the customer disputes the charges), but the transaction_risk_scores record for transaction 284910573621 on that same account shows mule_account_indicator=true and score_band='critical' as of 2026-06-29. Investigation case 2451087 is still open with sar_decision='pending_review'. Reconcile whether this is a victim Reg E claim or a mule account before recommending a disposition, and cite the governing policy sections.](/tests/aml-alert-investigation-agent-conflicting-signal-reconciliation.md)
- [Account 55871204 has three fraud_alerts entries (alert_type='business_email_compromise_wire') dated 2026-06-25, 2026-06-28, and 2026-06-30, with amount_at_risk of 8600.00, 9200.00, and 9750.00 spread across two branches. The most recent transaction_risk_scores record on file for that account is dated 2026-05-01. Investigation case 2287654's filing_deadline_date is 2026-07-06. Determine whether this triggers the structuring escalation and whether the SAR filing clock is at risk.](/tests/aml-alert-investigation-agent-structuring-stale-evidence.md)
