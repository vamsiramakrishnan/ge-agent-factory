- [The CEMS analyzer on asset #148820 (boiler_stack) last posted a sensor_reading at 2026-06-30T22:00:00Z, and the OSIsoft PI System shows a downtime_event on the same asset starting 2026-07-01T06:00:00Z for 'breakdown' lasting 640 minutes. BigQuery's cached_aggregates for the June monthly period already report full CO2e coverage for that source. Should June's boiler_stack emissions go into the report as-is?](/tests/regulatory-emissions-reporting-agent-stale-cems-evidence-gap.md)
