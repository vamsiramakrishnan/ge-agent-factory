# Detect a qualifying nonconformance_records entry against a lot in SAP S/4HANA QM (query_sap_s_4hana_qm_inspection_lots), open a structured capa_actions workspace, and draft the initial problem statement from the defect_code and severity classification.

The linked nonconformance record NC-641207 (defect_code: contamination, severity: major) shows containment_complete=true but mrb_required=true with no MRB disposition attached in SAP QM.

This morning nonconformance record NC-648831 was raised on the same material_number 412908 with defect_code dimensional and severity major, detected 2026-06-30. The BigQuery analytics_events feed shows dimensional-defect variance_pct has been trending outside the historical baseline for that material for three straight weeks.
