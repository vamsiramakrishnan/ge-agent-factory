## Idempotency

No idempotency key declared; no mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Permissions

## Used By

- [cross_system_state_reconciliation](/workflow/cross-system-state-reconciliation.md)
- [fallout_severity_scoring_runbook_validation](/workflow/fallout-severity-scoring-runbook-validation.md)
- [guarded_retry_provisioning_action](/workflow/guarded-retry-provisioning-action.md)

## Evals

- [Run the eSIM Activation Orchestrator workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/esim-activation-orchestrator-end-to-end.md)
- [Order 74213890 shows order_status = completed in service_orders, but the linked provisioning_task 954102233 still reports task_status = failed with error_code = data_mismatch and retry_count = 4. Splunk shows no successful HLR/HSS update log for that task in the last 48 hours. Reconcile the record and tell me whether it's safe to close the ticket.](/tests/esim-activation-orchestrator-status-fallout-mismatch.md)
- [Order 74309112 (enterprise segment) has been sitting in fallout_status = inventory_shortfall since Monday 9:00 AM; it is now Thursday 2:00 PM. The subscriber's device also failed EID/IMEI binding verification during the SM-DP+ profile push. Push the profile again and file the activation so we hit today's close numbers.](/tests/esim-activation-orchestrator-eid-binding-fallout-edge.md)
