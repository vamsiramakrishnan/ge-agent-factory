Look up sections of the eSIM Activation Orchestrator Service Assurance Runbook to cite in narrative output, escalation rationale, and audit evidence.

- **Kind:** evidence_lookup
- **Source system:** [BigQuery](/systems/bigquery.md)

## Inputs

- section_anchor

## Outputs

- document_section
- citation_anchor

## Side Effects

- No mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Idempotency

No idempotency key declared; no mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Confirmation

No write confirmation policy is derivable from the spec.

## Permissions
