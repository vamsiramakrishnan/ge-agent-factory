- [Port-in order 73418826 was rejected by the losing carrier for a ZIP mismatch on 2026-06-28, corrected and resubmitted on 2026-07-01, and was just rejected again — this time citing an account-number mismatch instead of the ZIP. Zendesk ticket #48213 shows the customer already threatened to cancel the port. Diagnose whether this is a genuine second CSR discrepancy or a stale CSR pull, and tell me the next action.](/tests/number-porting-exception-agent-csr-resubmission-conflict.md)
