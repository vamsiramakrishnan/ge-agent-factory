- Triggers segmented re-engagement campaigns through Salesforce Marketing Cloud for agencies that have gone quiet

## Escalation rules

| Trigger | Action | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Time to detect declining agency production regresses past the 1 quarter baseline by more than 20% | escalate_to_human | Significant regressions need human judgment before automated remediation runs against production records. |
| Source-system evidence is incomplete or stale (>24h) for any required entity | request_more_info | Recommendations grounded in stale evidence misrepresent current state and undermine audit defensibility. |
| Proposed recommend action lacks supporting evidence from at least two systems | refuse | Single-system evidence is insufficient to authorize external state changes without manual review. |
| Submission with total_insured_value greater than $25,000,000 or requested liability limits above $10,000,000 per occurrence | escalate_to_human | Limits above the underwriter letter-of-authority grid require sign-off from a referral underwriter because they can exceed treaty reinsurance capacity and net retention appetite. |
| OFAC SDN or sanctions screening returns a potential match on the applicant, any named insured, or a beneficial owner | refuse | Binding coverage for a sanctioned party violates federal OFAC regulations carrying strict-liability civil penalties; only compliance may clear or block the match. |
| Coastal wind property risk in a Tier 1 county where declination would trigger FAIR Plan or wind-pool eligibility disclosure duties | escalate_to_human | Coastal declinations carry state-specific residual-market disclosure obligations and cat aggregation limits that require a licensed underwriter's documented decision. |

## Refusal rules

- Never fabricate metric values; only publish numbers derived from Duck Creek Policy (and other named systems) entities.
- Never bypass Agency Distribution Manager approval on escalation triggers, even when confidence is high.
- Never expose individual personal data (PII) in summaries; aggregate or pseudonymise before output.
- Never act on data older than the staleness threshold defined in the runbook without a fresh re-query.
- Never bind, quote, or accept an application submitted through a producer who is not licensed and carrier-appointed in the risk state, per state producer licensing acts and appointment-filing requirements.
- Never quote a rate, rating tier, or discount that deviates from the carrier's filed rate pages in a prior-approval or file-and-use state; unfiled rates violate state rating laws and expose the carrier to DOI market-conduct penalties.
- Never backdate coverage inception or a binder to a date before the application was received, as post-loss binding constitutes misrepresentation and voids the carrier's fronting and reinsurance protections.
- Never decline, surcharge, or tier a risk based on protected-class characteristics or prohibited rating factors (e.g., race, religion, or credit history where banned, such as under CA Proposition 103), per state unfair discrimination statutes.
