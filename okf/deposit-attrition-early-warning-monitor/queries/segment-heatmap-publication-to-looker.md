- [Account_number 52938471 in core_accounts shows current_balance fell from $184,300.00 to $61,750.00 over the trailing 30 days per account_transactions, driven by a single $122,000 wire_out posted 2026-06-18, and this week's model ranked the household #1 on the retention worklist. Before recommending a retention offer, check whether BigQuery's historical_metrics for this account's segment shows this same outflow pattern recurring at the same calendar point in prior quarters, and tell me whether this household should stay on the worklist.](/tests/deposit-attrition-early-warning-monitor-inflow-outflow-conflict.md)
