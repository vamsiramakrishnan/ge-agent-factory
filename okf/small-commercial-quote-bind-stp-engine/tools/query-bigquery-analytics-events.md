## Used By

- [automated_risk_scoring_stp_eligibility](/workflow/automated-risk-scoring-stp-eligibility.md)

## Evals

- [Run the Small Commercial Quote-Bind STP Engine workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/small-commercial-quote-bind-stp-engine-end-to-end.md)
- [Submission SUB-004821 (ACORD_130_workers_comp, NAICS 238220, producing broker Coastal Business Insurers) shows loss_runs_received_5yr = false and total_insured_value of $3,200,000, but linked policy_quotes record QT-119773 already shows quote_status = bound with underwriting_tier = preferred. Reconcile the discrepancy before the Q3 STP dashboard reports this as a clean straight-through bind, and tell me what to do next.](/tests/small-commercial-quote-bind-stp-engine-tier-bind-mismatch.md)
- [Submission SUB-005560 (ACORD_140_property_section, insured Prairie Grain Cooperative LLC, NAICS 111998) lists total_insured_value of $24,850,000 — just under the $25,000,000 referral threshold — with requested liability limits of $9,800,000 per occurrence. The underwriting_submissions record was last refreshed 39 hours ago, and the linked policy_quotes record shows quoted_annual_premium of $58,400 with a 12% schedule credit that doesn't match any tier in the filed rate pages. Can we clear this for auto-bind today?](/tests/small-commercial-quote-bind-stp-engine-stale-rate-deviation.md)
