# query_bigquery_analytics_events

Retrieve analytics events from BigQuery for the Safety Observation Trend Analyzer workflow.

- **Kind:** query
- **Source system:** [BigQuery](/systems/bigquery.md)

## Inputs

- lookup_key
- date_range

## Outputs

- analytics_events_records
- analytics_events_summary

## Side Effects

- No mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Idempotency

No idempotency key declared; no mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Confirmation

No write confirmation policy is derivable from the spec.

## Permissions

No explicit permission scopes declared; source-system access is tied to [BigQuery](/systems/bigquery.md).

## Failure Modes

No explicit failure modes are declared in the spec; rely on refusal/escalation policies for unsafe or incomplete evidence.

## Used By

- [trend_clustering_leading_indicator_correlation](/workflow/trend-clustering-leading-indicator-correlation.md)

## Evals

- [Run the Safety Observation Trend Analyzer workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/safety-observation-trend-analyzer-end-to-end.md)
- [The trend dashboard already flags a 'leading indicator' cluster for confined-space near-misses in Area 3, third shift, over the last two weeks. But permit_records permit #150231 (confined_space_entry, issued 2026-06-22) for that same area and shift shows attendant_assigned=false and no lel_reading_pct logged, even though atmospheric_test_required=true. Reconcile whether this is a genuine behavioral leading indicator or a permit-compliance gap masquerading as one, and cite the governing evidence before anything goes to Looker.](/tests/safety-observation-trend-analyzer-permit-cluster-conflict.md)
- [Near-miss reports for 'unauthorized hot work without fire watch' have now shown up in Building 2 first shift, Building 4 second shift, and Building 7 third shift within the past 6 days — three distinct area/shift combinations. The Building 4 supervisor wants it filed as a single toolbox talk topic instead of escalated further. Determine the correct handling for this week's cycle.](/tests/safety-observation-trend-analyzer-cross-area-recurrence.md)
