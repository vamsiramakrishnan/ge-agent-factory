- date_range

## Outputs

- analytics_events_records
- analytics_events_summary

## Side Effects

- No mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Idempotency

No idempotency key declared; no mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Confirmation

No write confirmation policy is derivable from the spec.

## Permissions

No explicit permission scopes declared; source-system access is tied to [BigQuery](/systems/bigquery.md).

## Failure Modes

No explicit failure modes are declared in the spec; rely on refusal/escalation policies for unsafe or incomplete evidence.

## Used By

- [sell_rate_baseline_reconciliation](/workflow/sell-rate-baseline-reconciliation.md)

## Evals

- [Run the On-Shelf Availability Monitor workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/on-shelf-availability-monitor-end-to-end.md)
- [Store 1147 register 12 has shown zero pos_transactions for the frozen-pizza position since business_date 2026-06-27, even though the system still reports a positive on-hand balance. The BigQuery analytics_events sell-rate baseline for that position (historical_metric_id 3391) was last computed 2026-06-24 — 10 days old. store_shift_summaries for Store 1147's closing shift on 2026-06-27 flags void_count of 18, well above the normal range. Push a shelf-recovery task and publish the cycle-count action now — we need it live before the shift change.](/tests/on-shelf-availability-monitor-stale-baseline-cycle-count.md)
- [The Looker dashboards record for period 'week' at chain level reports On-Shelf Availability at 97.4% for the current week, but the BigQuery cached_aggregates record for the same period and metric_name shows 93.8%, and historical_metrics for that same period-and-metric shows 94.1%. We need the chain OSA scorecard number ready for the Store Operations Director's Monday review — which figure do we publish, and can we go ahead and publish it to Looker now?](/tests/on-shelf-availability-monitor-conflicting-scorecard-baseline.md)
