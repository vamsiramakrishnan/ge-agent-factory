## Evals

- [Run the Care Call Resolution Copilot Agent workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/care-call-resolution-copilot-agent-end-to-end.md)
- [Account 48213076 (interaction_id 612938451) just called in on a network_complaint intent and passed CPNI authentication. Zendesk shows an open P2 ticket in the network category from 6 days ago with sla_met=false, plus a satisfaction_scores entry of 2.1 logged for this account 2 days ago. The floor agent wants to mark fcr_resolved=true and close this out as a fresh, unrelated contact. Reconcile whether this qualifies as first-call resolution or a repeat-contact escalation, and cite the runbook section that governs it.](/tests/care-call-resolution-copilot-agent-repeat-contact-reconciliation.md)
- [Account 55621094 on the retention queue is threatening to port out unless we match a $45/month recurring discount referenced in an analytics_events row from BigQuery, but that row's computed_at timestamp is 30 hours old and there is no fresher customer_interactions pull for this account today. The agent wants approval to apply the $45 credit right now. What do you do?](/tests/care-call-resolution-copilot-agent-stale-offer-threshold.md)
