- date_range

## Outputs

- analytics_events_records
- analytics_events_summary

## Side Effects

- No mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Idempotency

No idempotency key declared; no mutation is declared by the spec for this tool.

## Confirmation

No write confirmation policy is derivable from the spec.

## Permissions

No explicit permission scopes declared; source-system access is tied to [BigQuery](/systems/bigquery.md).

## Failure Modes

No explicit failure modes are declared in the spec; rely on refusal/escalation policies for unsafe or incomplete evidence.

## Used By

- [rule_precision_recall_dollar_coverage_scoring](/workflow/rule-precision-recall-dollar-coverage-scoring.md)

## Evals

- [Run the Fraud Rule Tuning Analyzer workflow for the current period. Cite the relevant source-system evidence and surface any escalations required.](/tests/fraud-rule-tuning-analyzer-end-to-end.md)
- [Alert ID 74821093 (card_not_present, fraud_risk_score 92) was marked confirmed_fraud on 2026-06-30, but three similar alerts scored above 90 in the same rule cohort over the past 5 days were closed as false_positive. The desk wants to lower the card_not_present threshold from 85 to 78 today to cut queue volume before Friday's governance meeting. Evaluate whether the backtest sample supports a threshold change now, and if not, tell me what's missing.](/tests/fraud-rule-tuning-analyzer-partial-sample-threshold-edge.md)
- [Case 2104456 (typology fraud_referral, aggregate_suspicious_amount $187,400) resulted in sar_filed on 2026-06-25 after transaction risk scores from model trs_challenger_v4_0 flagged it, while Actimize is still running trs_champion_v3_2 in production. The VP of Fraud Strategy wants to promote v4_0 to champion today based on this one case. Also note the last BigQuery historical_metrics refresh for this rule cohort is dated 2026-06-10, more than 24 days stale. Walk me through whether we can approve the promotion now.](/tests/fraud-rule-tuning-analyzer-stale-champion-challenger-promotion.md)
