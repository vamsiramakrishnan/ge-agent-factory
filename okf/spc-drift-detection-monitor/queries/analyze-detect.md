# Compare current state against historical baselines and analytics events in BigQuery to detect gaps, score exceptions, and prioritize the Quality Engineer's queue.

## Tools used

- [query_bigquery_analytics_events](/tools/query-bigquery-analytics-events.md)
- [lookup_spc_drift_detection_monitor_sop](/tools/lookup-spc-drift-detection-monitor-sop.md)

## Runs in

- [analyze_detect](/workflow/analyze-detect.md)

## Evidence expected

- sql_result
- document_reference

## Evals
